Chelsea's notes from Stat545 about how to use R Studio
------------------------------------------------------

### Basic R notes

``` r
# <- ## makes an assignment (kind of like giving something a name/short hand)
objects() ## tells me what objects are in my workspace 
```

    ## character(0)

``` r
ls() ## also tells me what objects are in my workspace
```

    ## character(0)

``` r
rm() ## will remove an object
# rm(list = ls()) ## will remove all objects in workspace (can also do with broom in the environment)
```
