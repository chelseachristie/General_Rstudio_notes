## Chelsea's notes from Stat545 about how to use R Studio

### Basic R notes

```{r}
# <- ## makes an assignment (kind of like giving something a name/short hand)
objects() ## tells me what objects are in my workspace 
# ls() ## also tells me what objects are in my workspace
# rm() ## will remove an object
# rm(list = ls()) ## will remove all objects in workspace (can also do with broom in the environment)



```
