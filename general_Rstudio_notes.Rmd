## Chelsea's notes from Stat545 about how to use R Studio

### Basic R notes

see:
http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html

```{r}
# <- ## makes an assignment (kind of like giving something a name/short hand)
objects() ## tells me what objects are in my workspace 
# ls() ## also tells me what objects are in my workspace
# rm() ## will remove an object
# rm(list = ls()) ## will remove all objects in workspace (can also do with broom in the environment)

# (name <- whatever I'm naming/assigning ) putting an assignment in brackets will cause it print at the same time

# q() = quit Rstudio 

# getwd() = shows which working directory I"m "working in" and importantly where all the stuff I'm doing will get saved to

# Rstudio projects keep all the files associated with a project organized together â€“ input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures

```
